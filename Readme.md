## Description

Door Dash Clone - [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Problem Statement

1. It's a system for multiple restaurants, similar to Yelp or Door dash.
2. The user can preorder a specific dish option in the menu.
3. The user can view info with text, images and/or videos about a restaurant/dish.
4. The user can post a review about a restaurant/dish.
5. The review contains texts, images and/or videos.
6. The User can view other reviews.

Deliverable: Give me the UML, abstract interfaces, or whatever that can reflect the backend models/structures.

Also, discuss all the potential challenging parts you can think of as well as potential solutions for the indicated challenges.

## Challenges

1. File upload anti viral scan and isolation.
2. Preordering scheduling to restaurant notification, specifically variable hours of operation time window maximum? (assume only same day ordering)
3. Profanity / pornography filtering client & server side.
4. Scaled search / geographic suggestions
5. Point of sale integration for restaurants
6. Restaurant specific API endpoints (flagging / curating reviews & content - menu)
